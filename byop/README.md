# BYOD

# Why?

Sometimes, bringing other modules into your repository might introduce a lot of dependencies which could break things in your own project or may not work with how your project is set up.
Technically, you only care about the proto files used to communicate with the chain, and you can bring only them.

Use the `byop` module to register them without bringing a lot of baggage that comes with the project you are trying to include.
